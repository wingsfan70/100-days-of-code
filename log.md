# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Creating my project and respository on gitHub for my portfolio. I will be using pug and sass.

**Thoughts** Today I restarted my commitment to 100 days of code. I will start working on my portfolio website as part of
free code camp.
